                <h1>Blue Dress Girl Digital Painting</h1>
                <p>This digital painting was done as a favor for a friend and is based on actual photo of her. Although I have never worked with digital painting, 
                I have worked with traditional painting tools.This digital painting was made in Procreate for iPad. The process involved sketches as well as selecting
            particular textured brushes and contained around 40 layers. I put effort into every detail and proportion to make sure I captured a realistic look with the painting.  </p>
