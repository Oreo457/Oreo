                <h1>Valerie Book Cover</h1>
                <p>Valerie is a mystery about a teenager who loses her parents in a car accident. She moves in with her aunt and struggles with her grief.
                    This book cover features warm colors that convey a feeling of sadness which suited the theme of the book. Towards the bottom of the girl’s pupils and of the book cover, 
                    the colors start to desaturate which represents the girl slowly letting her grief control her. This is also represented by the 
                    fading of the title. As for the font, I went with a white colored “California” font from Dafont.com which adds a slight horror 
                    aesthetic to the cover while also providing some contrast. The elements in the background of the book cover provide some 
                    foreshadowing elements of the plot which include the car at night and a mysterious silhouette. This book cover was designed using Adobe Photoshop.
